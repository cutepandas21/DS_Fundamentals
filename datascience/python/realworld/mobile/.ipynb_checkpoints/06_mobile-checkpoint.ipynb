    "- **Cross-Platforms** \n",
    "\n",
    "Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. You can run the same code on all supported platforms. It can natively use most inputs, protocols and devices including WM_Touch, WM_Pen, Mac OS X Trackpad and Magic Mouse, Mtdev, Linux Kernel HID, TUIO. A multi-touch mouse simulator is included.\n",

    "Kivy is 100% free to use, under an MIT license (starting from 1.7.2) and LGPL 3 for the previous versions. The toolkit is professionally developed, backed and used. You can use it in a commercial product. The framework is stable and has a well documented API, plus a programming guide to help you get started.\n",
